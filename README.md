# Python data structures

## Objective

I created this repo so I can keep all the algorithms I create here and, maybe, help someone who might need them.

I'm learning Python, so I can't give knowledge of a lot of things in it yet, but I might help on clarifying the logic behind those codes. :)

Feel free to contact me.
